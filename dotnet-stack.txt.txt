.NET Stack: Frontend, Backend, Database

The .NET stack is a popular framework developed by Microsoft for building web, desktop, and mobile applications. It provides a complete ecosystem for full-stack development, using multiple languages like C# and F#.

- Frontend:
  The frontend in the .NET stack is often built using **ASP.NET Core with Razor Pages, Blazor, or MVC**. These tools help developers create interactive, responsive, and dynamic user interfaces for web applications.

- Backend:
  The backend is powered by **ASP.NET Core or .NET APIs**, which handle business logic, client requests, authentication, and server-side processing. The backend is robust, scalable, and secure, suitable for enterprise-level applications.

- Database:
  The .NET stack works well with various databases, including **SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and even NoSQL databases**. It interacts with databases using **Entity Framework** or **ADO.NET** for easy data management and retrieval.

Conclusion:
The .NET stack provides a powerful and flexible environment for building modern full-stack applications. Using .NET technologies for frontend, backend, and database integration allows developers to create secure, scalable, and maintain
