Frontend Technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Frontend development focuses on the user interface and experience of a website or web application. It is the part that users see and interact with, and it uses several core technologies to build responsive and interactive pages.

HTML (HyperText Markup Language):
HTML is the structure of a webpage. It defines elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, and lists. Without HTML, a web page cannot display content.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):
CSS is used to style HTML elements. It controls colors, fonts, layouts, spacing, and responsiveness. CSS makes websites visually appealing and ensures they look good on different devices.

JavaScript (JS):
JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It enables features like forms validation, sliders, pop-ups, animations, and real-time content updates. JS works closely with HTML and CSS to make web pages functional and engaging.


- React:
  React is a popular JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable components and manage the state of applications efficiently.

- Vue:
  Vue is a progressive JavaScript framework for building modern and reactive web interfaces. It is easy to learn, flexible, and suitable for both small and large-scale projects.

Conclusion:
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the foundation of frontend development. Together, they create websites that are structured, visually attractive, and interactive, providing a smooth and engaging user experience.
