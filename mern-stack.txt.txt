MERN Stack: MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js

The MERN stack is a popular set of technologies used for full-stack web development. It allows developers to build modern, scalable, and interactive web applications using JavaScript throughout the entire development process.

- Frontend (React):
  React is a JavaScript library used for building the user interface of a web application. It enables developers to create reusable components, manage the application state efficiently, and make the frontend interactive and dynamic.

- Backend (Node.js & Express.js):
  Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that runs server-side code, while Express.js is a framework built on Node.js to simplify backend development. Together, they handle client requests, implement business logic, and communicate with the database securely and efficiently.

- Database (MongoDB):
  MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. It is ideal for handling large volumes of data and allows easy integration with the backend using JavaScript. MongoDB ensures scalability and fast data access for web applications.

Conclusion:
The MERN stack provides a complete JavaScript-based solution for developing web applications. Using React, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB together allows developers to build modern, responsive, and efficient full-stack applications from frontend to backend.
