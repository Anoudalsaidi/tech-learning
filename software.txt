software

I learned that software works as the “brain” of devices, helping hardware understand what to do.

Different software types are designed for different purposes, such as productivity, entertainment, or system control.

I understood that good software must be secure, easy to use, and regularly updated.

I realized how important software is in simplifying daily tasks and improving work efficiency.
